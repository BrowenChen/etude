Etude is an etude generator which uses chord analysis and computational music methods
to create personalized sheet music for the user. Users may choose from the growing library 
of tunes, and will get a sheet composed just for them, based on the chord changes of the 
selected tune. Etude is currently in development stage, and more features are being added regularly.
